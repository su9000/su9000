## Hi there 👋

# Hi there, I'm **Susana Pedrosa**

## Currently working on
- Galaxy formation and evolution across cosmic time  
- Feedback from compact-object stellar systems (X-ray binaries at Cosmic Dawn)  
- Dynamical analysis of galaxies in the CIELO simulations  
- Angular momentum, bulge/disk decomposition, and LSBGs
- Using SWIFT simulations for studying the Cosmic Dawn

## Currently learning
- Modern Python practices for large-scale data analysis  
- HPC task-based parallelism in SWIFT  
- How to keep analysis files organized when the universe keeps expanding  

## Looking to collaborate on
- Cosmological simulations and high-redshift galaxy physics  
- Reproducible research tools for astrophysics  
- JWST-related science  

## Interests
- Exploring opportunities in industry and applied research  
- Expanding my work into data-intensive scientific environments  
- Entering the aerospace sector or collaborating with space-related companies  
- Bringing expertise in simulations, HPC and physical modeling to industry-impact projects
